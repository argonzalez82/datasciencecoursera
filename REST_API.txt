Week 2 Quiz  

Question 1
Register an application with the Github API here https://github.com/settings/applications. 
Access the API to get information on your instructors repositories 
(hint: this is the url you want "https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos"). 
Use this data to find the time that the datasharing repo was created. 
What time was it created?
This tutorial may be useful (https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/demo/oauth2-github.r). 
You may also need to run the code in the base R package and not R studio.
